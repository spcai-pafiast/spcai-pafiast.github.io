Further,\r\nsignificant developments in hardware innovation have lowered the monetary cost of data storage (less than\r\n$0.02 per GB), leading to a "store everything" mindset. One common trend is the need to store activity\r\ndata, also known as log data, which describes things that happen rather than things that are. Several\r\ndomains such as Internet companies and their web services, financial applications, scientific computing,\r\nand the Internet-of-Things (IoT) rely heavily on processing log data efficiently. This trend is further\r\nsupported by modern non-monolithic architectures such as microservices, containers, and task-based computing.\r\nToday, the activity data volume, velocity, and variety are staggering, reaching up to 7 TB/s, demanding a\r\nrethinking of the storage stack we have today.
